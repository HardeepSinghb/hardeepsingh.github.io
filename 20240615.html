            <h2>Combating Nihilism: A Mental Compass for Dark Moments</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I was in darkness and took these three steps and found myself in paradise. First is a good thought, second a good word and third a good deed.”</p>
                <footer>— Friedrich Nietzsche</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is the most profound exercise I do of the mind when I find myself in a dark situation. I don’t know what to do and sometimes I take a step in the wrong direction. In those situations, we need some mental model to see some light in the darkness or to find meaning in your life. This helps me to stay on the right track and not to go on the path of nihilism, drugs, and porn.</p>
            <h3>Three Steps</h3>
            <h4>Good Thought:</h4>
            <p>In the lowest moments I need light or I am lost like a NPC (non-playing character) in a computer game.</p>
            <img class="img" src="aLight.jpg" >
            <blockquote>
                <p>"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light"</p>
                <footer>— Aristotle Onassis</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A good thought is like a light source which is the only source of hope in the dark. It is like a compass which gives us direction. It gives me hope, it can transform me or it can do nothing but save me from being lost.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“A thought, even a possibility, can shatter and transform us.”</p>
                <footer>— Friedrich Nietzsche</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A good thought can make us better and a bad one can be perilous. There is no advantage to thinking bad in a bad situation. The situation gets worse by doing that. But thinking good and positive can make me a better human.</p>
            <h4>Good Word:</h4>
            <p>Say good words because in that position a bad word to thyself and to others pushes you further into the abyss.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Good words are worth much, and cost little."</p>
                <footer>— George Herbert</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Say good words to thyself and others. They are truly worth more and cost me little.</p>
            <h4>Good Deed:</h4>
            <img class="img" src="hand.jpg">
            <p>Then do something good. Nobody could ever stop me from doing that but myself alone.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Good character and acts for the common good.”</p>
                <footer>— Marcus Aurelius</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>“Try to be useful. You do things that are useful to your fellow human beings and to the world. It's very hard to be useful, very hard. Are you contributing more than you consume? Can you try to have a positive net contribution to society?”</p>
            <p><em>— Elon Musk (on the Lex Friedman podcast)</em></p>
            <p>Good actions make society better but they also act as a feedback loop to your further thoughts and actions. Then after doing that I have to remind myself that</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"A man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season."</p>
                <footer>— Marcus Aurelius</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I am not good at these things but we need to take these small steps to make further progress in life.</p>
